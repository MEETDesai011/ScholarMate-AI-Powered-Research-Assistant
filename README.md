## üöÄ Key Features

* **One-Click Actions:** Instantly **Summarize** articles, **Translate** text, or **Proofread** your writing.
* **Grab Selection:** Use the "Grab selection" button to instantly capture highlighted text from your active webpage.
* **Hybrid AI Processing:** Features an advanced settings panel to choose your preferred AI engine:
    * **Hybrid (Default):** Attempts to use the fast, on-device `chrome.ai.LanguageModel` (Gemini Nano) first. If it fails, it automatically falls back to the powerful Cloud AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash).
    * **Built-in AI Only:** Exclusively uses the on-device `chrome.ai.LanguageModel`.
    * **Cloud AI Only:** Exclusively uses the external Gemini 2.5 Flash API.
* **Light & Dark Mode:** Includes a theme toggle in the settings for a personalized experience. Your preference is saved locally.
* **Helpful Error Handling:** If the built-in AI fails, the extension provides clear, actionable steps for the user (e.g., how to enable Chrome flags).
* **Simple UI:** A clean interface with "Copy Output" and "Clear" buttons for an efficient workflow.
